    "## 简介\n",
    "本教程会介绍使用seq2seq模型实现一个chatbot，使用的训练数据来自[Cornell电影对话语料库](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html)。对话系统是目前的研究热点，它在客服、可穿戴设备和智能家居等场景有广泛应用。传统的对话系统要么基于检索的方法——提前准备一个问答库，根据用户的输入寻找类似的问题和答案。这更像一个问答系统，它很难进行多轮的交互，而且答案是固定不变的。要么基于预先设置的对话流程，这主要用于slot-filling(Task-Oriented)的任务，比如查询机票需要用户提供日期，达到城市等信息。这种方法的缺点是比较死板，如果用户的意图在设计的流程之外，那么就无法处理，而且对话的流程也一般比较固定，要支持用户随意的话题内跳转和话题间切换比较困难。因此目前学术界的研究热点是根据大量的对话数据，自动的End-to-End的使用Seq2Seq模型学习对话模型。它的好处是不需要人来设计这个对话流程，完全是数据驱动的方法。它的缺点是流程不受人(开发者)控制，在严肃的场景(比如客服)下使用会有比较大的风险，而且需要大量的对话数据，这在很多实际应用中是很难得到的。因此目前更多的是用于类似小冰的闲聊机器人上。本文使用的[Cornell电影对话语料库](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html)就是偏向于闲聊的语料库。当然最近也有不少论文研究把这种方法用于task-oriented的任务，但还不是太成熟，在业界还很少被使用。\n",

    "> hello?\n",
    "Bot: hello .\n",
    "> where am I?\n",
    "Bot: you re in a hospital .\n",

    "> how are you doing?\n",

    "\n",
    "对于某些问题，比如图像来说，输入可能是固定大小的(或者通过预处理缩放成固定大小），但是对于文本来说，我们很难把一个二十个词的句子\"缩放\"成十个词同时还保持语义不变。但是为了充分利用GPU等计算自由，我们又必须变成固定大小的Tensor，因此我们通常会使用Padding的技巧，把短的句子补充上零使得输入大小是(batch, max_length)，这样通过一次就能实现一个batch数据的forward或者backward计算。当然padding的部分的结果是没有意义的，比如某个句子实际长度是5，而max_length是10，那么最终forward的输出应该是第5个时刻的输出，后面5个时刻计算是无用功。方向计算梯度的时候也是类似的，我们需要从第5个时刻开始反向计算梯度。为了提高效率，通常把长度接近的训练数据放到一个batch里面，这样无用的计算是最少的。因此我们通常把全部训练数据根据长度划分成一些组，比如长度小于4的一组，长度4到8的一组，长度8到12的一组，...。然后每次随机的选择一个组，再随机的从一组里选择batch个数据。不过本教程并没有这么做，而是每次随机的从所有pair里随机选择batch个数据。\n",
    "\n",
    "原始的输入通常是batch个list，表示batch个句子，因此自然的表示方法为(batch, max_length)，这种表示方法第一维是batch，每移动一个下标得到的是一个样本的max_length个词(包括padding)。因为RNN的依赖关系，我们在计算t+1时刻必须知道t时刻的结果，因此我们无法用多个核同时计算一个样本的forward。但是不同样本之间是没有依赖关系的，因此我们可以在根据t时刻batch样本的当前状态计算batch个样本的输出和新状态，然后再计算t+2时刻，...。为了便于GPU一次取出t时刻的batch个数据，我们通常把输入从(batch, max_length)变成(max_length, batch)，这样使得t时刻的batch个数据在内存(显存)中是连续的，从而读取效率更高。这个过程如下图所示，原始输入的大小是(batch=6, max_length=4)，转置之后变成(4,6)。这样某个时刻的6个样本数据在内存中是连续的。\n",
